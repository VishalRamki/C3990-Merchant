# C3390-Merchant Interface

This is the Merchant interface. It is designed to run on a web server. So pairing it with Apache or XMAPP is optimal.

If you are running this locally in order to communicate with Google, you need to run it through a server.

# Install Instructions

1. Install either XAMPP or Apache.
2. Move the files into the `htdocs` or `/var/www/html` in order to access it.
3. Launch/Run the server and access it via your root or `http://localhost/C3990-Merchant`

> The App is programmed to interface with our server, currently hosted [C3990.ddns.net](C3990.ddns.net)
